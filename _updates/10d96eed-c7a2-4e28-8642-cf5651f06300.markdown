“The Dutch have always hated penalties and considered the shoot-out an abomination. But its merciless, made-for-TV melodrama has its admirers. In his book On Penalties Andrew Anthony argues that, ‘The shoot-out is as near perfect an allegory of the human condition as sport offers. Of course, the field is rich in experiential metaphors, with all the triumphs and disasters, winners and losers, and countless other stupefying clichés that make up the world of competitive games. The beauty of the penalty, though, is that it powerfully represents the fear and the hope, the regret or relief that are compressed into the meaningful junctures of life. The football penalty is unique in sport because of the emphasis it places on conscious choice. For a brief period, the game stops and the penalty taker enters his own chamber of truth, a place where actions have ineluctable consequences. The penalty shoot-out goes even further. In its combination of individual choice and collective responsibility it attains an almost moral significance.’”
